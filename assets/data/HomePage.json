Currently, I am trying to put my earned skills into use to help others find online solutions for their needs.<br/>I have done some boot camps where we learned to collaborate, plan, design, code and test in a teamwork, AGILE, active learning environment.<br/>My previous roles include teaching and research in Physics, which has helped me develop my interpersonal, soft and technical skills as well."
